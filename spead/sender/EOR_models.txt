The EOR models are makde from the EOS 12cmFAST simulations, using the
recommended faint galaxies model, processed with prep_box.py.
prep_box.py averages the 1024x1024x1024 image predictions to smaller
16x128x128 cubes, which steps in ~0.2MHz increments over a 16Mpc sky.
That is approx 12deg (I think).
show_box.py skips the slow conversion of the full res files, but does
the same -- and will show you plots if show_plot=True

The steps are uniform in co-moving distance, provided in redshift, and
converted to frequency steps by me. (So could be wrong!)

One file is missing from the simulation.

There are 4 corner markers of low flux, point sources and zero spectral index.i
The nominal frequency is the first freq channel (~220MHz).

EOR+Foreground adds in a model from NGC1566. prep_box (or show_box) will do
this, if it is avaliable.  The model has 0 SI and a nominal frequency of 1GHz.

The models are centred on 201,-44 in degrees, span +- 6degrees. 16 models are
made from each redshift simulation. The SI is used to extrapolate from one
model to the next. As the changes are very abrupt using a model far from the
nominal frequency will generate nonsense. One could set the SI to zero in this
case.

The models are gaussians of width of the 128pixels over 12 deg. Which is
close to 1 arcmin.
